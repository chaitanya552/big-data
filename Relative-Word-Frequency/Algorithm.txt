My Algorithm:


Input file: 100KWikiText.txt 

Output: Top 100 Wordpairs with their relative frequency.

Steps:

*Create a mapper and reducer
*Mapper will form keys and values of single words(word1 #, 1)
*Mapper will form keys and values of paired words(word1 word2, 1) 


*In reducer,  we check if the key is a single word or word pair. 
1#
-If it’s a single word then I will examine if the key is equal to current word(which is initially set to B-L-A-N-K) and then count the total number of occurrences	
-If not, then I will set it as current word and I am counting the occurrences of this word.


	
2#
-If it’s a word pair then I am counting the total occurrences and finding out the relative frequencies. 
I am Inserting these into the tree relative frequency, word Pair and first word.
The elements in the tree set are arranged in decreasing order of Relative Frequency. Now I'm trimming the when it reaches more than 100.
Now I will have Top 100 word pairs with relative frequencies. 



3#
Now I am printing the output to a file.
